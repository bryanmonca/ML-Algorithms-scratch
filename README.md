# cmsi535-Machine-Learning
In these in class exercises and assignments we built different machine learning algorithms from scratch and compare results with scikit-learnâ€™s implementation:

* Exercise3 - Building Perceptron model
* Exercise4 - Building Linear Regression
* Exercise5 - Polynomial Feature Expansion
* Exercise6 - Overfitting/Underfitting and Ridge Regression
* Exercise7 - Gradient Descent for mean squared loss
* Exercise8 - Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction
* Exercise9 - PCA as a generative model
* Exercise10 - Neural Networks using pytorch

* Assignment1 - Multi-Class Perceptron
* Assignment2 - Ridge Regression Closed form solution
* Assignment3 - Stochastic Gradient Descent and momentum

Data obtained from sklearn datasets: boston house-prices dataset (regression), breast cancer wisconsin dataset (classification), and iris dataset (classification)
